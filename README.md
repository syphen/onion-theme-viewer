# Onion Theme Viewer

A simple way to view OnionOS themes and modify configuration options on-the-fly.

Drag and drop a theme onto the app to preview, modify config.json settings on the left-side and see the preview update.
Navigate using your keyboard (left, right, up, down, space, enter, a, b), the faux keys on the interface, or on-screen elements by clicking them.
